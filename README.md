# CryptoClustering

cryptoclustering_challenge
Module 19 Challenge

Instructions
Here's what I'll be doing in this project:

Rename the file "Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb" to "Crypto_Clustering.ipynb" for better organization.

Load the "crypto_market_data.csv" into a DataFrame.

Get the summary statistics and plot the data to get an overview of how it looks.

CryptoClustering: Predicting Cryptocurrency Price Changes Hey there!

I'm working on a cool project called CryptoClustering! In this challenge, I'll use Python and unsupervised learning to predict how cryptocurrencies are affected by price changes within 24 hours or 7 days.

Here's what I'll be doing:

Create a New Repository: I've set up a new repository called CryptoClustering.

Data Exploration: I'll check out the data by loading the crypto_market_data.csv into a DataFrame and taking a quick look at it.

Data Preparation: I'll prepare the data for analysis using the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn.

Finding the Best Value for k: I'll use the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters.

Clustering Cryptocurrencies: I'll use K-means to cluster the cryptocurrencies and visualize the results.

Optimizing Clusters with PCA: To improve the clusters, I'll perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the data.

Finding the Best Value for k using PCA Data: I'll use the elbow method again, but this time on the PCA data.

Clustering Cryptocurrencies with K-means using PCA Data: I'll cluster the cryptocurrencies based on the PCA data.

Visualizing and Comparing the Results: I'll create some cool plots to compare the clustering results.
